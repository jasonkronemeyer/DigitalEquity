- Internet Equity Initiative at the University of Chicago: https://internetequity.org/
- Hardware-Based Broadband Testing Iniative at Merit Network Research: https://www.merit.edu/networkresearch
- Broadband and Digital Inclusion initiatives at the Quello Center: https://quello.msu.edu/broadbanddigitalinclusion/
