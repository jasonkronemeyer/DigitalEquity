## Digital Equity Learning

Hello World! We are MADS Capstone Project Team 26. Allow us to introduce ourselves: Te, Osas, and Jason. Weâ€™ve been working on the Digital Equity Learning project, and it has been quite a journey.
Our adventure began with a qualitative analysis of the Netrics dataset. Our goal was to understand the various attributes related to quality of experience in terms of Internet or network connectivity. Throughout this journey, weâ€™ve learned and applied many skills that we developed during the MADS program.
For data wrangling, we utilized libraries such as Pandas, GeoPandas, Fiona and Shapely. Additionally, we delved into network analysis libraries like NetworkX and OSMNx to gather and analyze network data geospacially. Our unique idea emerged: geospatially representing Internet connections and the supporting infrastructure. We also explored the distribution of higher-quality infrastructure compared to areas with lower-quality infrastructure. We visualized knowledge with Matplotlib and Seaborne.
Our journey didnâ€™t stop there. We conducted statistical analyses, implemented random forests, and used regressors. Through visualizations, we aimed to tell the story of how quality of infrastructure relates to digital equity. Our hope is that the foundational framework weâ€™ve developed can evolve with new data, especially as it becomes continuously available through higher-velocity public sources.
Why do we do this? To accelerate policy interventions, promote digital equity, and foster digital adoption. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to participate in the digital economy.
Weâ€™ve thoroughly enjoyed this project and appreciate the chance to share it with you. Feel free to explore our GitHub repository and read our report. Have a fantastic day, and GoBlue!





Hello World from **UMSI MADS Capstone Project Team 26: Digital Equity Learning**!

Our project is a social good project related to finding key insights in digital data and the relationship between network Quality of Experience (QoE) and Digital Equity.
We are looking to connect and collaborate with researchers in the community who would have background knowledge of datasets from intiatives such as:

- Digital Inclusion project at the Michigan Institute For Data Science (MIDAS): https://midas.umich.edu/ds-for-public-good/
- Internet Equity Initiative at the University of Chicago: https://internetequity.org/
- Hardware-Based Broadband Testing Iniative at Merit Network Research: https://www.merit.edu/networkresearch
- Broadband and Digital Inclusion initiatives at the Quello Center: https://quello.msu.edu/broadbanddigitalinclusion/
- EUPConnect Collaborative: https://www.eupconnect.org

 
Any connections you can help us make are greatly appreciated!
